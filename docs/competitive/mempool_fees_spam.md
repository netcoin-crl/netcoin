**Status:** scaffolded / default-off.

**Purpose:** Dynamic fees, relay policy, eviction, RBF/CPFP, dependency limits, dust/UTXO-bloat controls, and analytics.

## Code anchors

- Module: `netcoin/competitive/mempool.py`
- Config: `config/competitive/mempool_fees_spam.json`

## Level-5 Baseline

This area has been promoted from scaffold-only to NetCoin's 5/10 midlevel baseline. The baseline means there are deterministic testnet/dev code hooks, validation helpers, operator controls, and smoke tests. It does not mean the area is externally audited, legally cleared, custody-ready, or mainnet-ready.

Acceptance requirements for the baseline:

- Feature rows report `midlevel_testnet` with `maturity_score: 5`.
- Area module exposes `default_controls()`, `feature_matrix()`, `readiness_gates()`, and `smoke_check()`.
- `python tools/competitive_gap_report.py --level5 --validate` must pass.
- Production claims remain blocked until independent audit and legal/security review are complete.
